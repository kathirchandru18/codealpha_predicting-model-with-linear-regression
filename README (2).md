# LinerRegression-House-Price-Prediction-Model


## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a house price prediction model using linear regression. The model takes into account various features of a house and aims to predict its price. This can be a useful tool for real estate professionals, buyers, and sellers to estimate house prices.


## Usage

1. **Data Collection**: Collect and prepare a dataset containing the features mentioned above and their corresponding house prices. This dataset will be used to train and evaluate the model.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding for the location), and normalizing/standardizing numerical features.

3. **Training the Model**: Use the preprocessed dataset to train the linear regression model. The model will learn the coefficients for each feature to predict house prices.

4. **Evaluation**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

5. **Prediction**: After training, the model can be used to predict house prices given a new set of feature values.

## Files

- `data.csv`: A sample dataset containing house features and prices for training and testing the model.
- `linear_regression.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the step-by-step process of data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- `model.pkl`: A serialized version of the trained linear regression model using a library like `pickle`.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn


## Note

This linear regression model provides a basic understanding of predicting house prices and may not capture all the complexities of real-world housing markets. More advanced models, feature engineering, and larger datasets can be explored for more accurate predictions.
